Requirements for the README update:
* Look at the last 10 commits in the repository to identify recent changes only.
* Use the existing README structure as a guide [README.md](../../README.md)
* Ensure the new section is consistent with the current style and formatting for markdown.
* Update the README.md file with the new changes at the beginning of the file with a latest section header and date.
* Include a brief summary of the changes made, focusing on the new features or improvements.
* Use markdownlint to ensure the updated README.md file is properly formatted.
